About this project 

This project is inspired by the TimeofFlight sensor which is detected and counts the number of people in the room. In this project, we use 2 sensors ( Distance sensor and Temperature sensor ) to make another version of TimeofFlight to count people and control the light.
So far, this project can be applied for smart homes which detect and automatically turn on the light when people step into their house.
